# folder-renaming
Applying to jobs requires adapting a main CV to each job. This script elimates the manual process of renaming your Word (aka, *.doc or *.docx file), and exporting it to a *.pdf file.

This script scans a folder for any new Word(*.doc or *.docx file), and when it detects a new file, it renames it in the following format:
MM.DD - [your_name] - [parent_folder_name] - CV

It also then exports the Word file into a PDF file. 

There are additional checks to ensure that the file exporting only happens once, and the .pdf file is always updated. 

It saves me at least 20+ mins everyday doing a very manual error-prone process.
